# Measuring-philanthropy
How much is India's philanthropic capital?

Ashoka University's CSIP (Centre for Social Impact and Philanthropy) asked us (How India Lives), how much is the 
philanthropic capital of India really? There's plenty of estimates out there, but none based on real data. This exercise
shone light on the real challenge in estimating this number. In India, there are estimatedly 31 lakh NGO's (shorturl.at/hwCFT) 
registered under the Societies' Registration Act. There could be more, that exist but are unregistered. 

At the time of data mining, we probably got 10% or fewer than this official number. 

Our aim was to gather funds each NGO received in a year. For this exercise, we mined sources like Darpan, Government of 
India's CSR (corporate social responsibility) database, IT department's and FCRA's (Foreign Contributions Regulations Act) 
database. All these databases are public and easily accessible. 

This data was gathered and stored in SQL database for ease of cleaning and analysis. Python was primarily used for data mining
and cleaning. 

If you were wondering, could we finally answered the question? We could not. Because, not all the NGO's are still registered.
For what we really found through this large data gathering exercise, here'e the analysis that CSIP built on the numbers we
estimated for them : Advocacy, Rights and Civil Society report - http://csip.ashoka.edu.in/research-and-knowledge/
